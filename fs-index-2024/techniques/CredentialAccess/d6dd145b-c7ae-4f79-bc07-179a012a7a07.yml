- Enable object logging for directory services via Group Policy Advanced Audit then alert when non-domin controller sources replicate directory objects. Specifically, look for Event ID 4662 events where the action performed was related to replicating object changes (e.g. either/both of "Replicating Directory Changes all" and "{1131f6aa-9c07-11d1-f79f-00c04fc2dcd2}"/"{1131f6aa-9c07-11d1-f79f-00c04fc2dcd2}")
