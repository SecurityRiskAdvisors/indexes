name: Load known-abusable kernel driver
description: Load a legitimate and signed kernel driver that is vulnerable to exploitation. Refer to projects like KDU (https://github.com/hfiref0x/KDU/) for potential vulnerable drivers to use. Vulnerable, signed drivers provide a privileged (kernel) execution mechanism to attackers, allowing them to bypass security controls they couldn't otherwise bypass, such as by killing protected processes.
platforms:
- windows
guidance:
- CMD> sc.exe create {{ gen_svc_name }} type= kernel start= demand error= normal binpath= c:\windows\System32\Drivers\{{ sys_file }} displayname= {{ gen_svc_name }}
- CMD> sc.exe start {{ gen_svc_name }}
block:
- Use built-in Windows security features like HVCI and WDAC to block loading of drivers based on hash and/or signature characteristics.

detect:
- Anomalous driver load detected by endpoint security tool or in the SIEM via telemetry data, such as Sysmon ID 6
